# U Spin Sum Rules

**Note**:  I am no longer working on this project, and there are multiple errors in the notes and some portions of the algorithm missing in the notebook, but I welcome anyone to use it if they want to push it further.

`u_spin_v2.nb` is a Mathematica notebook containing a work-in-progress algorithm to find the number of U Spin sum rules for particle physics processes at any order (higher orders may take some time, but not unreasonable amounts, this is a drawback of using Mathematica).

`notes_v3.pdf` contains my notes on finding U-spin sum rules for a subset of these processes. I have tried my best in referencing the papers and reviews that I used.  Furthermore, these are my personal notes so there will be errors.
